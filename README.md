# Graph-GUI-JavaFX

## Description

This is a demonstration of the basic functionalities of __WEIGHTED GRAPHS__ implemented in __JavaFX__. A simple __GUI application__ that allows the user to insert and delete vertices and edges (thus creating a graph) and also display the path between two vertices using the __Dijkstra's algorithm__. If the user is lazy to ADD vertices and edges, there is an __IMPORT DATA__ functionality that gives the user the freedom to import a text file with the required information in it (refer "testInput.txt").

To EXPORT the current status of the graph, create an EMPTY TEXT FILE beforehand (say "exportData.txt"). Click the __EXPORT DATA__ button and select the empty text file that you've just created (in this case "exportData.txt"). View the contents by opening the file.

## Instructions

__Please READ the QUESTION (QUESTION.pdf) before running the GUI application.__

The code is contained inside the file entitled __"GraphGUI.java".__

Before Running The Application:

- The file must be opened in JAVA Eclipse (JDK 8 onwards). 

- Ensure that JavaFX is installed in the Eclipse interface.

- Create a new package (of your choice) and rename the package in the code accordingly (the first line of the code is 
 > package application;
 
. If you have created a new package named "Test", then change the first line to 
> package Test;

)

- Create a new class. (For example, if you have named the class "TestClass", change the line 137 to 
> public class TestClass extends Application;

)

__NOTE: Refer to the screenshots for further guidance.__

__NOTE: The file "testInput.txt" is a sample text input file for importing data.__
