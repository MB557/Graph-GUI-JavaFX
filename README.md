# Graph-GUI-JavaFX
Please READ the QUESTION (QUESTION.pdf) before running the GUI application.

The code is contained inside the file entitled "GraphGUI.java".

This is a demonstration of the basic functionalities of WEIGHTED GRAPHS implemented in JavaFX. A simple GUI application that allows the user to insert and delete vertices and edges (thus creating a graph) and also display the path between two vertices using the Dijkstra's algorithm. If the user is lazy to ADD vertices and edges, there is an IMPORT DATA functionality that gives the user the freedom to import a text file with the required information in it (refer "testInput.txt").

To EXPORT the current status of the graph, create an EMPTY TEXT FILE beforehand (say "exportData.txt"). Click the EXPORT DATA button and select the empty text file that you've just created (in this case "exportData.txt"). View the contents by opening the file.

Before Running The Application:

•       The file must be opened in JAVA Eclipse. 

•       Ensure that JavaFX is installed in the Eclipse interface.

•       Create a new package (of your choice) and rename the package in the code accordingly (the first line of the code is "import package application;". If you have created a new package named "Test", then change the first line to "import package Test;")

•       Create a new class. (For example, if you have named the class "TestClass", change the line 137 to "public class TestClass extends Application"

NOTE: Refer to the screenshots for further guidance.

NOTE: The file "testInput.txt" is a sample text input file for importing data.
